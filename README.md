# Algolab solutions

These are my solutions for the [ETH "Algorithms Lab" course](http://www.vvz.ethz.ch/Vorlesungsverzeichnis/lerneinheit.view?lerneinheitId=140963&semkez=2020W&ansicht=KATALOGDATEN&lang=en) (autumn semester 2020, HS20).

The course organizers **strongly recommend not to look** at other people's solutions, at least until you have gotten most of the points by yourself. You should follow that advice.

Sometimes other people's solutions helped me find or understand a "trick" that was necessary for full points, so that's why I published mine.
